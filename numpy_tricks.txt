While working on array we sometimes create a copy of an array
for example let suppose we have an array  

arr = np.arange(0,11)

let suppose we have to do something which require all the element of this array 
if we use p = arr[:] and make some changes in p according to our uses,then our original array "arr"
changes,and if we dont want any changes in original aaray we make a copy of original array by using 
a code like  m = arr.copy()  and if we perform  changes in "m"
our original array "arr" is unchanged
basically what i find is we have other option also like if we use 
m = arr*1
if we do any changes in  array "m" it won't affect original array "arr"
similarily, we can use m = arr+0 it works as well.
